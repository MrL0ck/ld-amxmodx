## No Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V

Please avoid copy-pasting junk of code from other scripts available on the internet. If you feel need to do so, please read the respective license for the code, make sure the you place a reference/link to the original source in the newly created content, and adjust the code to the coding standards listed below.

## Coding Standards

Nothing special here. Please try to do the following:

* Use `under_scores` instead of `camelCase`.
* Type definitions should have `_t` suffix.
* Constants should be in `ALL_CAPS`.
* Use four-space indentation instead of tabs.
* No whitecharacters at the end of line.
* Unix line endings.
* For Pawn scripts, use `#pragma semicolon 1` and `#pragma ctrlchar '\'`.

That is all for now.
